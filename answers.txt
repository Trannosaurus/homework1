What is the difference between a merge and a rebase?

Merging:

  Integrates changes from one branch into another.
  Preserves the branch histories, creating merge commits.
  Simple and suitable for collaborative projects.

Rebasing:

  Integrates changes by rewriting the commit history.
  Creates a linear history without merge commits.
  Useful for cleaner, more readable histories, but should be used cautiously in shared branches.
